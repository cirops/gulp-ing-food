## Gulp(ing) Food! Project

This project was created to practice Gulp and simple API querying.

**Update 2021**: This project aged like fine egg, so I've updated all the dependencies and the gulpfile to v4 so that it at least runs, and doesn't have countless vulnerabilities anymore because of outdated packages. Also, The API used for querying recipes, RecipePuppy, seems to be broken, which means I'll have to find another similar API. Best-looking candidate so far: [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs)

### Running the project
- Clone the repository;
- run `npm install` on the root folder;
